/// Selections allow powerful data-driven transformation of the document object
/// model (DOM): set [attributes][], [styles][], [properties][], [HTML][] or
/// [text][] content, and more. Using the [data join][]â€™s [enter][] and [exit][]
/// selections, you can also [add][] or [remove][] elements to correspond to
